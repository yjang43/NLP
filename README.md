# NLP
## Overview
Implemented my own version of **natural language processing** focused on implementing computer to _define a word_ on its own and search for most _appropriate word that comes next_. Text input in data.txt file can be replaced with any other text. Things to keep in mind are __more input will require more time to compute__ and __less input will lead to inaccuracy of the output__.
## Implementation Detail
Each word is counted as one unique dimension, and by interacting with other words, element related to this impact is chnaged in that dimension. Good analogy will be interaction between molecules. A change in one molecule makes that molecule to apply dfferent force to other molecules.

**input**: dear bear I will like to eat some candy
**output_1**: something had been hanging out of smell, you are dangerous
**output_2**: filled with its fiery breath and Gretel to unfold
**output_3**: she felt like a gingerbread door; and apologized for saying mean things sometime, like her idea
